## Overview

*Mint Works* is a refreshingly light worker placement game for 1 to 4 players --
easy to learn, with enough depth to keep you coming back.

Players take the role of neighborhood planners and will be working to develop
the finest neighborhood in *Mintopia City*.
To do so they start with \[Mint\]\[Mint\]\[Mint\] and will gain \[Mint\]
every round.
With these \[Mint\] they will activate Locations to gain more \[Mint\], buy Plans
and build those Plans.
Built Plans will grant them abilities, effects and \[Star\].
When the game ends the player with the most \[Star\] wins.

### Gameplay

Each round is divided into two phases:
The Development phase followed by the Upkeep phase.

#### Development

The player currently holding he Start Player Token starts the round.

A player has two options on their turn. They may choose either
*Place* or *Pass*.
After completing one of these actions play then continues clockwise
to the next player.

- *Place*: The player chooses an unoccupied Mint Placement Space and places the required
amount of \[Mint\] on it, granting the player the Location's Effect.
- *Pass*: The playerâ€™sturn is over.On their next turn they will have the chance to choose
*Place* or *Pass* again.

This keeps going until all players consecutively pass, ending the Development
phase.
Afterwards proceed to the Upkeep Phase.


#### Upkeep \[Upkeep\]

1. If any player has seven or more \[Star\] provided by built Plans in their
Neighborhood, the game ends and Scoring takes place.
2. The Plan Supply is then refilled to three face up Cards from the Plan Deck.
If it was not possible to refill the Plan Supply,
the game ends and Scoring takes place.
3. Resolve all \[Upkeep\] Effects.
4. Return all \[Mint\] on any Location's Mint Placement Spaces to the Mint Supply.
5. Each player gains \[Mint\].
6. Proceed to the next Development Phase.

### Scoring

Count the total number of \[Star\] each player each player earns from built Plans in their Neighborhood.

The player with the **most** \[Star\] has the finest Neighborhood and wins!

If two or more players are tied for first place, the tied player with the **smallest** Neighborhood (i.e. fewest Plans) wins. If there is still a tie, the tied player with the **most** \[Mint\] wins. Still tied? You all win!

### AI Cards

* Title
* Processing Logic
* Starting Mint Token Share
* Cost Preference
* Supplier Buy Priority

### Solitaire-specific Rules

The competitive rules apply to the solitaire mode of Mint Works. There are however a few exceptions:

* When a Plan is taken from the Plan Supply and not **immediately** replaced by another effect, replace it with one from the Plan Deck.
* During \[Upkeep\], if no \[Mint\] is on the Supplier before returning all \[Mint\] to the Mint Supply, put the two Plans in the Plan Supply on the bottom of the Plan Deck, and replace them by two new Plans from the Plan Deck.
* When the AI performs the Place action, it will **always** choose *Place* and use the first available Mint Placement Space in the Location line, that they **can use**, starting with the Producer.
* If the AI is unable to use any Location, it chooses *Pass*.
* When performing *Place* for the AI, place the required amount of \[Mint\] from its supply on the corresponding Mint Placement Space.
* The AI will buy Plans based on Cost Preference. If there is a tie for Cost, it buys according to its Supplier Buy Priority. If there is still a tie, it will buy the Plan closest to the Plan Deck.
* The AI will build the **oldest** unbuilt Plan in its Neighborhood first.
