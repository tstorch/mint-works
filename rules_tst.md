## Gameplay

### Development

A player has two options on their turn. They may choose either
the Place or Pass action.
After completing one of these actions play then continues clockwise
with the next player.

This keeps going until all players consecutively pass, ending the Development
phase.
Afterwards proceed to the Upkeep Phase.

#### Place

amount of [Mint] on it, granting the player the Location's Effect.


#### Pass

*Place* or *Pass* again.

Neighborhood, the game ends and Scoring takes place.
2. The Plan Supply is then refilled to three face up Cards from the Plan Deck.
If it was not possible to fill the Plan Supply,
the game ends and Scoring takes place.

## Scoring
